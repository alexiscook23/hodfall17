1. A paragraph describing your project: what will you be predicting, why it is interesting to do this.
For my project, I'll be looking at changes in environmental policy to predict and quantify their impact on environmental factors. Some potential factors I could predict would be gross emissions, water and energy consumption, waste production, chemical and toxins release, and air and water purity. I find this interesting because I know humans have an enormous impact on the environment, but it often feels like a topic approached as political debate rather than a matter of fact and data. Especially with the current and anticipated changes in environmental policy under the Trump administration, I'd be interested to predict the impact in quantifiable terms.   

2. A description of where you will find this data.
Governmental agencies like the EPA have published data on their website. Other sites include the World Bank's public data online, the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development)'s public data, which is generally grouped by topic and country. I also think there are independent data sets, which may be helpful in case I have reason to question the data of certain agencies that may have incentive to distribute the data to convey a certain message. 

3. A few lines describing your dependent variable in detail. What is the nature of this outcome as a variable?
I'm not sure if I'll have a single variable that I work with, such as total gas emissions grouped by each state, or if I'll include multiple environmental variables. I think comparing data by state could be interesting and give a more nuanced view of the issue, especially if states have different standards for various factors such as emissions or waste. Because the EPA enforces variables like air pollution and waste and chemical contamination, these two variables are already closely monitored in regards to various companies. I would like to look at the data on a state or national scale, but I could do this using the same data sources.
