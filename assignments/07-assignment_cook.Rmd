For this assignment, I want you to use the Census ACS API to download and plot data. Complete the following steps:
```{r}
library(rvest)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(acs)
library(noncensus)
library(leaflet)
library(tigris)
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE) # save tigris shapefiles
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)
library(tidyverse)
```


1. Download data for all of the zip codes in Los Angeles county on education levels. 
2. Compute the proportion of the population that has a bachelor's degree or above by zip code.
3. Download data for all of the zip codes in LA county on family income by zip code. 
4. Compute the proportion of the population that has family income above 75,000. 

```{r}
## Look up fips code for county
lookup_code("CA","Los Angeles") 

state_fips<-"06"
county_stub<-"037"
county_fips<-paste0(state_fips,county_stub)

# Get dataset that matches all zip codes to cities, counties and states. 
county_to_zip<-read_csv("http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/rel/zcta_county_rel_10.txt")

#easier names to work with

#Just zip codes in selected county

if (get_acs_data==TRUE){
  
api.key.install(acs_key, file = "key.rda")

select_zip<-geo.make(zip.code=ziplist) 

county_educ=acs.fetch(geography=select_zip,

save(county_df,file="dav.RData")

5. Download data for all of the zip codes in LA county on health insurance coverage status (you'll need to look that table up here:[http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/summary-file-documentation.html](http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/summary-file-documentation.html).
6. Calculate the proportion of the population in each zip code that is uninsured. 
```{r}
#my acs key
acs_key<-"6a40376acbf5ba1669c71e128f22503adba853c8"

get_acs_data<-TRUE #set this up so that after you get the data you can turn this to "false" and not have to run this every time cuz it takes awhile

if (get_acs_data==TRUE){
  
api.key.install(acs_key, file = "key.rda")

select_zip<-geo.make(zip.code=ziplist) 

county_insur=acs.fetch(geography=select_zip, 
                      endyear=2014,
                      table.number="B27001", #health insurance by sex by age
                      col.names="pretty",verbose=T) 

acs.colnames(county_insur)

## Proportion of individuals without insurance
prop_uninsured<-divide.acs(numerator=(county_educ[,15]+
                                      county_educ[,16]+
                                      county_educ[,17]+
                                      county_educ[,18]+ 
                                      county_educ[,32]+
                                      county_educ[,33]+
                                      county_educ[,34]+
                                      county_educ[,35]),
                            denominator=county_educ[,1]
)


# Convert to tibble
county_un<-tibble(substr(geography(county_insur)[[1]],7,63),
                       as.numeric(estimate(prop_uninsured))
) 

# Give it easy to use names
names(county_un)<-c("zip","uninsured")
save(county_un,file="insur.RData")
}else{
  load("insur.RData")
}

View(county_un) 
```


7. Plot the proportion uninsured as a function of education, and then as a function of income. 
```{r education}
#Merge  datasets
zip_df_un<-left_join(county_df,county_un,by="zip")
zip_df_un<-left_join(zip_un,city_zip,by="zip")

#Bar plot of uninsured by education
g6<-ggplot(zip_df_un,
           aes(x=fct_reorder(as.factor(college_educ),uninsured),y=uninsured,fill=uninsured,text=city))

g6<-g6+scale_fill_gradient(low="blue",high="red")

g6<-g6+geom_bar(stat="identity")

g6<-g6+xlab("Proportion of Residents with College Degree")+ylab("Proportion of Uninsured")

g6<-g6+theme(legend.position="none")

g6

```
```{r income}
#Bar plot of uninsured by income
g6<-ggplot(zip_df_un,
           aes(x=income_75,y=uninsured,fill=uninsured,text=city))

g6<-g6+scale_fill_gradient(low="blue",high="red")

g6<-g6+geom_bar(stat="identity")

g6<-g6+xlab("Proportion of Residents with Income>75K")+ylab("Proportion of Uninsured")

g6<-g6+theme(legend.position="none")

g6

```
8. Model the proportion uninsured as a function of education, income _and one other variable of your choice_. 

```{r}

#Predict uninsured by income and education
mod1<-lm(uninsured~college_educ+income_75,data=zip_df_un);summary(mod1)

```
